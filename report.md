# Bahrain Convenience/Availability

"""

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

This submission will eventually become your Data section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Data section) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

## Introduction

I am looking for a place stay as a young adult, but more importantly, I'm looking for the kind of areas that I can stay and to place them in different categories depending on the shops/venues that surround them. This gives me an idea of not just popular locations but similar locations across the country.

I think that a lot of people, not just the youth could benefit from this solution, because the problem isn't finding a decent place to stay in Bahrain, but finding one that best serves their interests. Thus, by neatly categorizing areas by their surrounding attributes (such as frequency of coffee shops, closeness to malls etc) they can make a better guesstimate of where they might stay next. Foursquare allows us to grab information about venues surrounding a given location, and therefore we will look into the most frequent kind of venues surrounding a given area, and cluster areas based on their surrounding venues.
